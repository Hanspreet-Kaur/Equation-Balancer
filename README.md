# Chemical Equation Balancer

## Overview

The Chemical Equation Balancer is a software project aimed at balancing chemical equations. It provides a solution to one of the fundamental problems in chemistry, which is ensuring that the number of atoms of each element is equal on both sides of a chemical equation.

This project uses an algorithm to analyze the input chemical equation and automatically balances it by adjusting the coefficients of the reactants and products. It can handle equations with multiple reactants and products, as well as equations involving complex compounds.

## Features

The Chemical Equation Balancer offers the following features:

1. **Automatic Balancing**: Given an unbalanced chemical equation, the program automatically balances it by adjusting the coefficients of the reactants and products.

2. **Support for Complex Equations**: The program can handle complex equations with multiple reactants and products, as well as equations involving polyatomic ions and compounds.

3. **Element Tracking**: The program keeps track of the elements involved in the equation, ensuring that the number of atoms of each element is balanced on both sides.

4. **User-friendly Interface**: The project includes a user-friendly interface that allows users to input chemical equations and view the balanced output.

## Installation

To use the Chemical Equation Balancer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/equation-balancer.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd equation-balancer`

3. Run the program: `python main.py`

## Usage

1. Launch the program by running `python main.py`.

2. Enter the chemical equation you want to balance in the provided input field.

3. The balanced equation will be displayed on the screen.

## Example

Let's say we want to balance the following chemical equation:

```
Fe + O2 -> Fe2O3
```

Running the program with this equation as input will give us the balanced equation:

```
4 Fe + 3 O2 -> 2 Fe2O3
```
